# Huffman Coding Compression Project
#### Noah Himed
#### 12 September 2020

This repo contains software implementation of the Huffman Coding
file compression algorithm meant to compress text files.

C++ files implementing the algorithm may be found in the `src` 
subdirectory, while examples of text files compressed by the software 
may be found under `examples`. 

## Running the Software

To build the project, run the makefile that can be found in `src` to ensure 
that source code is compiled with the correct version of C++ specified for g++.
This will generate an executable called `huffman_encoder`

To compress a file, run the following command:

	./[exe name] [path to .huf or .txt file]

Doing so with a file path to a text file will generate a compressed file 
(same name but with the extension `.huf`) in the same direcotory, while 
running the command with a file path to a compressed `.huf` file will generate a 
decompressed text file, again of the same name but with a `.txt` extension.

### Example

Using the executable generated by the provided makefile, to compress a text file
containing the entire contents of Lewis Carroll's novel "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", 
a user might run a command like the following:

	./huffman_encoder /Users/johndoe/Documents/alice29.txt

Doing so will generate a file called `alice29.huf` in the same directory. 

To decompress the resulting `.huf` file generated by the above command, a user may run an additional
command like the following to get back the original text file:

	./huffman_encoder /Users/janedoe/Downloads/alice29.huf

Doing so will generate a file called `alice29.txt` in the same directory.

## Reduction in File Size

For very small files on the order of a few bytes, this software will tend to create a `.huf` file
of greater size than the original `.txt` file. However, for text files much bigger, the `.huf` file generated
will be much smaller than the original file. As text files increase in size, the resulting `.huf` files will
gradually approach a size of ~57% that of the original text files.

Below is a table summarizing the results of running the software on the files provided in the `examples` folder:

| File Name | Original Size | Compressed Size | Compressed File to Original File Size Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sam.txt | 13B | 23B | 176.92% |
| asyoulik.txt | 122KB | 74KB | 60.66% |
| lcet10.txt | 417KB | 245KB | 58.75% |
| alice29.txt | 149KB | 86KB | 57.72% |
| plrabn12.txt | 471KB | 269KB | 57.11% |
